You can do everything you might usually do. 

That means you can add test. 

This website is an example coming from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html). We're making websites today! Learn more about this site [here](about.html).

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) for a ton of data science.

To show that you can just use Rmd like normal, check out [this page](plots.html) with plots. 

Here's a picture of Snoopy!
