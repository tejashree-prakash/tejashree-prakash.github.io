We often make plots in data science. Basically, we can use Rmd the same way as usual even to create a website!

Here's tidyverse.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe. 

```{r}
plot_df <-
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2),
    y = 1 + 2*x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

Here's a plot. This seems to show 

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$


```{r}
plot_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point()
```
