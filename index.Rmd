### Hi, I'm **Tejashree Prakash**!<br>

I'm a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
  
I specialize in **Population and Family Health** with a concentration in **Biostatistics and Applied Public Health Data Science**.
  
My passion lies at the intersection of *applied research methods* and *health system quality improvement*. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how *social determinants of health* influence outcomes at both the individual and population levels, and in using *data-driven approaches* to promote equity and effectiveness in public health practice. I have a deep commitment to improving health outcomes related to reproductive and sexual health for minority women.<br><br>
